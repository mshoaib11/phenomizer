# phenomizer
The project is about building and implementing an iOS App "The phenomizer" to facilitate the disease prediction from a set of phenotypes. The App is intended for medical doctors and
performs computational clinical diagnosis to return the results to the doctor. Through the App, the doctor can search or select one or more phenotype(s) from a list and these phenotype(s)
are queried against a database of known diseases that are associated with the selected pheno-type(s). The diseases are then ranked upon the likelihood of them being caused by the queried
phenotype(s). Results are then displayed to the doctor.
